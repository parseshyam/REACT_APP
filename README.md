1. I could have used the redux for state management and thunk for dispatchcing async action but for now i've kept it simple.
2. Didn't got that Zip crux.
3. If there's no ["text/html"] or ["text/plain"] link found it will show nothing !

### Clone and run :-
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


Please let me know my code review !!
